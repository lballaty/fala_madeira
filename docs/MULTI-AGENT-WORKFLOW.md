## 1. The one idea

> **A folder holds one branch. Give each line of work its own folder (worktree). One shared `.git` underneath ties them together.**

So agents don't share a branch — they each get their own *folder on disk*, on their own *branch*. Nobody's `git checkout` ever yanks the floor out from under anyone else.

---

## 2. The workshop layout (each folder = a worktree = one branch)

```
   ┌─────────────────────────  ONE repository (single shared .git)  ─────────────────────────┐
   │                                                                                          │
   │   📁 fala_madeira/            → branch: develop   → integration line + docs + test runs  │
   │   📁 fala_madeira-feat/       → branch: feat/*    → Agent E  (enhancements)              │
   │   📁 fala_madeira-support/    → branch: fix/*     → Agent S  (support-ticket fixes)      │
   │   📁 fala_madeira-release/    → branch: main      → releases + `npm run deploy` ONLY     │
   │                                                                                          │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         each folder has its OWN node_modules / dist ; they share only the .git history
```

- **Agent D (design/docs)** works in the base `fala_madeira/` on `develop` (docs rarely collide).
- **Agent T (tests)** runs the suite in `fala_madeira/` on `develop` — the integration point everyone merges into.
- Need a hotfix while `develop` has half-done work? Spin up `fala_madeira-hotfix/` on `hotfix/*`, fix, merge, remove it.

## 3. How work flows (feature → develop → main → testers)

```
   Agent E   feat/loops     ●──●──●──┐
                                     │
   Agent S   fix/tickets    ●──●─────┤     merge when each is done
                                     ▼
                        ┌────────  develop  ────────┐      Agent T runs the FULL
   Agent D   docs ──────┤   (everything integrates)  │◄──  regression here. Green?
                        └───────────┬───────────────┘      → cut a release.
                                    │  (in the release folder only)
                                    ▼
                                  main  ──►  bump version + tag  ──►  🚀 npm run deploy → testers
                                    │
                                    └──────── back-merge main → develop (carry the version bump) ───►
```

---

## 4. A release does NOT stop anyone (the snapshot idea)

The release is just a **photo of `develop` at one moment**. Agents keep working; later commits ride the *next* release.

```
   develop:   A ── B ── C ─────── D ── E ── F ──►   (agents keep committing the whole time)
                        │
                        └─ release taken here  →  ships A B C
                                                  D E F automatically go in the NEXT release
```

- Merging `develop`→`main` happens in the **release folder** and reads develop's *committed history* — it never touches the base folder's files.
- The only decision is **when** to take the photo (right after tests are green), made on the shared tracker. That's timing, not a work-stoppage.

---

## 5. The safety nets (why agents don't collide)

```
   ①  Worktrees + branches   → separate desks. Different folders, different branches. No elbow-bumping.
   ②  queuectl reservations  → an "I've got this" sign on SHARED files any agent might touch
                               (trackers, AGENTS.md, migrations, config.ts). Reserve → edit → release.
   ③  Shared trackers        → the whiteboard: who's doing what + every deferral
                               (TESTER-FEEDBACK-TRACKER.md, E2E-LIVE-RUN-TRACKER.md).
   ④  Branch guard           → the bouncer. `npm run check:branch` + a pre-commit hook BLOCK a commit
                               if a folder is on the wrong branch (e.g. base folder drifted to main).
```

## 6. A day in the life

1. **E** opens `fala_madeira-feat/`, `git switch -c feat/loops`, builds the enhancement, commits there.
2. **S** opens `fala_madeira-support/`, `git switch -c fix/tickets`, fixes a ticket, commits there.
3. **D** updates design docs in `fala_madeira/` on `develop`; reserves the docs via `queuectl` first (shared files).
4. E and S each **merge their branch into `develop`** when done.
5. **T** runs `npm run test:e2e` on `develop`. Green ✓.
6. Someone cuts a release **in `fala_madeira-release/`**: `git merge --no-ff develop` → bump + tag → `npm run deploy` → push. Testers get it. Nobody else paused.
7. **Back-merge** `main`→`develop` so the version bump is everywhere.

---

## 7. Release checklist (the "press the button" steps)

```
   [ ] develop is green   (Agent T: full regression passed)
   [ ] shared tracker says "cutting release" (so nobody merges mid-cut)
   [ ] cd fala_madeira-release/  (on main)
   [ ] git merge --no-ff develop     (reconcile any main-only commits)
   [ ] version bump + CHANGELOG + tag vYYYY.MM.DD.N
   [ ] npm run deploy   (→ Verpex)   ;  verify prod
   [ ] git push main + tags
   [ ] back-merge main → develop
```

## 8. Setup choice — **Model B adopted (2026-07-14)**

- **Model A — shared develop:** feature agents all work in the base `fala_madeira/` on `develop`, isolated only by `queuectl` file reservations. *Simplest (one `node_modules`), but agents share one working tree — more reservation traffic, and a test build can read files another agent is mid-edit.*
- **Model B — a worktree per agent (pictured above):** each agent gets its own folder + feature branch. *True isolation, no working-tree contention; costs one `node_modules` per folder + merges into develop.* **Recommended for genuinely independent parallel agents.**

**Adopted: Model B.** The branch guard (`npm run check:branch` + the `.githooks/pre-commit` hook) enforces its rules: base = `develop`, feature worktrees = a topic branch (never `develop`/`main`), `*-release` = `main`.
